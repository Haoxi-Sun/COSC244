Q6 If 3 clients have connected to CharServer, how many threads are running assuming no client has terminated. Include the client threads in your count.
   Server: 4 (1 main thread, listening to socket + 3 ch threads for each connection)

If you did not correctly answer Q6, complete this question after you get the correct answer and before you leave the lab. You will not get the mark for this lab until both questions are answered correctly.
