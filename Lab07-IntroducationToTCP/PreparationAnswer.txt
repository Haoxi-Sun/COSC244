Q1 What is this class meant for?
   An InputStreamReader is a bridge from byte streams to character streams: It reads bytes and decodes them into characters using a specified charset. The charset that it uses may be specified by name or may be given explicitly, or the platform's default charset may be accpeted.

Q2 What does the explanation say to do for best effciency? Write the suggested statement.
   For top efficiency, consider wrapping an InputStreamReader within a BufferedReader.
   BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));

Q3 What method do you used to read a line from an input stream? What does it return?
   public String readLine();
   A String containing the contents of the line, not including any line termination characters, or null if the end of the stream has been reached.

Q4 What does the method, println(String x) do? What does it return?
   Prints a String and then terminates the line. This method behaves as though it invokes print(String) and then println().
 	Return nothing.

Q5 What does the constructor ServerSocket(int port) do?
   Creates a server socket, bound to the specified port.

Q6 What does the method accept() do? What does it return?
   Listens for a connection to be made to this socket and accepts it.
   Returns the new Socket.

Q7 Which constructor do you think is the most appropriate?
   Socket(InetAddress address, int port);
   Which creates a stream socket and connects it to the specified port number at the specified IP address.

Q8 What does the method getInputStream() return?
   Returns an input stream for this socket.

Q9 What method would you use to have a socket use an OutputStream?
   public OutputStream getOutputStream();
   Returna an output stream for this socket.

Q10 When you use the default constructor to create an instance of Date, what is it initialized with?
    Allocates a Date object and initializes it so that it represents the time at which it was allocated, measured to the nearest millisecond.

Q11 Write the code fragment required to print the current date and time to standard output.
    Date date = new Date();
    int d = date.getDate();
    long time = date.getTime();
    System.out.println(d+" "+time);

Q12 In the Usage error message, what is meant by <port> [host]?
    The error occurred in <port> or [host].
